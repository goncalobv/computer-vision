imread returns: uint8
Convert from uint8 to double, to allow math operations
to cast to double: double()
rgb2gray accepts argument: uint8
to do subtractions use: double images (also works with uint8 images...)
process_im requires: double image
to apply threshold_im use uint8 rather than double images
g=[121]'*[121]/16;
I3 = conv2(I2, g); % Convolve image with filter mask
I3 = conv2(I2, g, 'same'); % Convolve image, but keep original size
